              One of the best decisions I made as a teen was signing up for
              professional modeling classes at Models & Images. M&I helped me
              gain confidence, poise, and style--skills that continue to benefit
              me through the years.

              I LOVE working with MODOCOP! They are very organized and
              professional. They respond quickly to any emails you send them.
              The pay is great, and best part of all... you receive your check
              within a week or so, unlike many other companies.
